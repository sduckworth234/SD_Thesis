# Low-Light Vision for Search and Rescue UAV Systems

**SD Thesis Project - 2025**

This repository contains the complete codebase, documentation, and experimental data for a thesis project focused on developing an autonomous UAV system for search and rescue operations in low-light environments. The project integrates multiple computer vision technologies including ORB-SLAM2, YOLO v4, ZERO-DCE++, SCI, and other low-light image enhancement models.

## üéØ Project Objective

Develop and benchmark a modular UAV system equipped with an Intel RealSense D435i camera capable of:
- **Autonomous navigation** in GPS-denied environments using visual SLAM
- **Person detection** in low-light conditions using enhanced YOLO v4
- **Real-time image enhancement** for improved visibility in dark disaster scenarios
- **Edge deployment** on Jetson Xavier NX for real-world applications

## üöÅ Target Application

Search and rescue operations in dark, disaster-stricken environments where traditional lighting is unavailable and GPS signals are compromised.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Hardware Platforms

### Software Stack
- **ROS Noetic** for system integration and communication
- **ORB-SLAM2** for visual simultaneous localization and mapping
- **YOLO v4** for real-time person detection
- **ZERO-DCE++** and **SCI** for low-light image enhancement
- **Gazebo** and **RViz** for simulation and visualization
